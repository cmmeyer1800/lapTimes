<br />
This website is the data repository for all motorsport testing laptimes. It uses a flask backend to recieve data transmitted by a micro controller on the ground.
This data will hit an API which processes and shows the data to the end user. From there data can be sent to a long term storage of all lap time data at /history.
<br /><br />
This will allow us to have an accurate history in order to better understand the improvements we make on the car moving forward.
